IMPORT CONVENTION
	You must follow this order to avoid error
		import 'dart' packages first
		import flutter packages next
		import other packages
		import your app in-built packages

USING MATH
import 'dart:math';

	 Use Random to generate integer
	 Random().nextInt(max); // max is the maximum number. It generates btw 0 and max-1


WIDGET LIFECYCLE

Stateless Widgets
	constructor function
	build()

Statefull Widgets
	constructor function
	initState()
		This is when the widget is first initialized
	build()
	setState()
		Something has changed, so we want the widget to rebuild
	didUpdateWidget()
		This is when a widget has been updated
		build() is called again
	dispose()
		This is executed once the widget is removed from the view


APP LIFECYCLE
inactive
	When app is inactive, no user input received
paused
	App not visible to user, running in background
resumed
	App is again visible and responding to user input
suspending
	App is about to be suspended (exited)
HOW TO USER THEM
class _MyHomePageState extends State<MyHomePage> with WidgetBindingObserver {
	....
		....
	..
	  ..

	// Tell your app to listen to the observers
	@override
	void initState() {
		WidgetsBinding.instance.addObserver(this);
		super.initState();
	}


	@override
	void didChangeAppLifecycleState(AppLifecycleState state) {
		...
		print(state);
		// state.AppLifecycleState.inactive;
		// state.AppLifecycleState.paused;
		// state.AppLifecycleState.resumed;
		// state.AppLifecycleState.suspended;
	}

	// Remove/clear the listening
	@override
	void dispose() {
		WidgetsBinding.instance.removeObserver(this);
		super.dispose();
	}
}
